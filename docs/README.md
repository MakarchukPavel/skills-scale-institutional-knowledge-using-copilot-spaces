# OctoAcme Project Management

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a validated, lifecycle-driven approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, iterative delivery, and continuous improvement. Our methodology guides projects through five key phases: **Initiation**, **Planning**, **Execution**, **Release**, and **Retrospective**. Each phase produces specific artifacts—from the initial Project One-pager and stakeholder alignment during initiation, through prioritized backlogs and release plans during planning, to retrospective action items that drive ongoing improvements. This structured approach ensures projects are well-defined, properly resourced, and consistently delivered with measurable outcomes.

Our project teams operate with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. **Project Managers (PMs)** coordinate delivery activities, schedules, risks, and communications. **Product Managers (PdMs)** define outcomes, prioritize backlogs, and measure success. **Developers** implement features while collaborating on design and testability, and **QA/Testing** validates quality against acceptance criteria. Responsibilities are documented in our roles guide and communicated through regular touchpoints including weekly PM-PdM syncs, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates. Escalation paths are clearly defined, progressing from team-level triage through PM and Product Lead to sponsor-level involvement for business-impacting issues.

Communication and quality assurance are foundational to our process. Teams maintain rhythm through daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and sprint demos. Status updates follow standardized templates covering progress, next steps, risks, and decisions needed. For quality assurance, we enforce unit tests for new logic, integration tests where applicable, and end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows. Our PR workflow requires small changes (≤400 lines when possible), automated CI testing and linting, and at least one approval before merging. Security scanning is integrated into CI, and releases follow a structured checklist including staging verification, rollback plans, and post-deploy validation.

Continuous improvement is embedded in our culture through regular retrospectives after each sprint, release, or incident. These sessions capture what went well, what could improve, and generate prioritized action items with clear owners and timelines. By measuring the impact of improvements and celebrating progress, we foster psychological safety and encourage ongoing learning across all teams.
